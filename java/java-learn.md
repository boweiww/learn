1. A 'hello world' in java:
public class MyClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}

2.Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs. As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa.

3.Compile Java C:\Users\Your Name>javac MyClass.java. Run compiled file: C:\Users\Your Name>java MyClass. Remember that you need to make sure there is javac.exe exist in you java/bin folder. 

4.A class should always start with an uppercase first letter. Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.

5.The name of the java file must match the class name and that every program must contain the main() method.

6.Syntex for declearing Java variable: type variable = value;

7.However, you can add the final keyword if you don't want others (or yourself) to overwrite existing values (this will declare the variable as "final" or "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only)

8.Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes 

9.The long data type should end the value with an "L". The float data type should end the value with an "f". The double data type should end the value with a "d".

10.The precision of float is only six or seven decimal digits, while double variables have a precision of about 15 digits. Therefore it is safer to use double for most calculations.

11.Alternatively, you can use ASCII values to display certain characters: char a = 65, b = 66, c = 67;
