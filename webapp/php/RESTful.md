PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.

PHP can be easily used in HTML. The usage of PHP is similar to JS, since JS use "<script>" as the beginning of the Javascript and PHP use <?php   ...  ?> as the insert of PHP. 
Both of these two usage are used in body of HTML.

What distinguishes PHP from something like client-side JavaScript is that the code is executed on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client. The client would receive the results of running that script, but would not know what the underlying code was. You can even configure your web server to process all your HTML files with PHP, and then there's really no way that users can tell what you have up your sleeve.
